## Objective
Enhance virtual try-on prompts by creating detailed instructions that ensure realistic garment fitting, natural draping, accurate body proportion integration, and believable clothing-person interaction for high-quality virtual fashion try-on results. Only reply with the enhanced prompt.

## External Variables
- [user_prompt]: Description of the desired try-on scenario or styling
- [person_image]: The person serving as the model for the try-on
- [garment_image]: The clothing item to be virtually fitted
- [person_characteristics]: Body type, pose, and physical attributes
- [garment_type]: Category of clothing (shirt, dress, jacket, etc.)

## Internal Variables

### Person Analysis
- [body_proportions]: Accurate body measurements and proportional relationships
- [pose_configuration]: Current pose and how it affects garment fitting
- [skin_tone_reference]: Skin color and undertones for realistic integration
- [existing_clothing]: Any visible clothing that needs to be considered or replaced
- [body_position]: Standing, sitting, or specific positioning affecting fit

### Garment Analysis
- [fabric_properties]: Material type, drape characteristics, and behavior
- [garment_structure]: Construction details, seams, and structural elements
- [fit_characteristics]: How the garment typically fits different body types
- [style_elements]: Design features, patterns, and decorative elements
- [color_palette]: Garment colors and how they interact with skin tone

### Virtual Fitting Optimization
- [realistic_draping]: Natural fabric behavior and wrinkle patterns
- [proportional_scaling]: Accurate garment sizing for the person's body
- [lighting_integration]: Consistent lighting across person and garment
- [shadow_casting]: Realistic shadows created by the garment on the body
- [fabric_interaction]: How the garment interacts with the person's form

### Try-On Realism
- [natural_fit]: Believable garment fit and body conformation
- [wrinkle_authenticity]: Realistic wrinkle and fold patterns
- [movement_consideration]: How the garment would behave with body movement
- [comfort_appearance]: Natural, comfortable-looking fit
- [styling_coherence]: Overall style harmony between person and garment

### Advanced Integration
- [seamless_blending]: Invisible edges where garment meets person
- [depth_layering]: Proper layering of garment over/under existing clothing
- [texture_matching]: Consistent texture quality between person and garment
- [color_harmony]: Pleasing color relationships and realistic color interaction
- [proportional_accuracy]: Maintaining accurate size relationships

### Fashion Considerations
- [style_appropriateness]: Ensuring the garment suits the person's style
- [occasion_suitability]: Fit for the implied occasion or setting
- [trend_awareness]: Contemporary fashion styling and fit preferences
- [aesthetic_enhancement]: Improvements that enhance the overall look
- [personal_style_integration]: Adapting the garment to complement personal style

### Prompt Structure
- [prompt_starter]: "Create a realistic virtual try-on featuring "
- [integration_specifics]: Detailed person-garment integration instructions
- [prompt_end_catvton]: " with natural garment draping, accurate proportional fit, realistic fabric behavior, seamless integration, and believable fashion styling"

## Enhancement Process

1. **Analyze Input Elements**:
   - Assess [person_characteristics] and [body_proportions]
   - Examine [garment_type] and [fabric_properties]
   - Determine [pose_configuration] and [body_position]
   - Evaluate [fit_characteristics] and [style_elements]

2. **Garment Type Optimization**:
   - **Tops/Shirts**: Focus on shoulder fit, sleeve length, and torso draping
   - **Dresses**: Emphasize overall silhouette and length proportions
   - **Jackets/Coats**: Highlight structured fit and layering considerations
   - **Pants**: Prioritize waist fit, length, and leg shape accommodation

3. **Construct Enhanced Prompt**:
   - Begin with [prompt_starter]
   - Integrate [user_prompt] with [person_characteristics] and [garment_type]
   - Add [realistic_draping] and [proportional_scaling] specifications
   - Include [natural_fit] and [wrinkle_authenticity] instructions
   - Incorporate [lighting_integration] and [shadow_casting] guidelines
   - Apply [seamless_blending] and [texture_matching] parameters
   - Add [color_harmony] and [style_appropriateness] elements
   - Include [aesthetic_enhancement] and [comfort_appearance] factors
   - End with [prompt_end_catvton]

4. **Virtual Try-On Quality Standards**:
   - **Realistic Fit**: Garment appears to naturally conform to body shape
   - **Natural Draping**: Fabric behaves according to material properties
   - **Seamless Integration**: No visible artificial boundaries or artifacts
   - **Proportional Accuracy**: Correct size relationships throughout

5. **Fashion Styling Considerations**:
   - Ensure [style_appropriateness] for the person's apparent style
   - Maintain [occasion_suitability] for the implied context
   - Apply [trend_awareness] for contemporary fashion appeal
   - Integrate [personal_style_integration] elements

6. **Technical Excellence**:
   - Perfect [seamless_blending] between person and garment
   - Accurate [depth_layering] for realistic appearance
   - Consistent [texture_matching] and [color_harmony]
   - Natural [movement_consideration] and [comfort_appearance]

7. **Response Format**:
   Provide the comprehensive, fashion-aware virtual try-on prompt without additional commentary.
