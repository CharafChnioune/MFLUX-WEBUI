- [prompt_end_enhanced]: " with extraordinary detail, artistic sophistication, technical excellence, and compelling visual impact"

## Enhancement Process

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**:
   - Analyze [user_prompt] for core concepts and creative intent
   - Identify [tab_context] for context-specific optimization strategies
   - Assess [image_context] if available for reference-aware enhancement
   - Determine [generation_purpose] for targeted enhancement approach

2. **Multi-Layered Enhancement Strategy**:
   - **Subject Mastery**: Develop [primary_subject] with [subject_characteristics] depth
   - **Environmental Excellence**: Create rich [environment_type] with [spatial_relationships]
   - **Visual Sophistication**: Apply [lighting_mastery], [color_harmony], [texture_sophistication]
   - **Artistic Elevation**: Integrate [style_specification] with [creative_sophistication]
   - **Context Optimization**: Apply [tab_specific_enhancement] and [workflow_continuity]

3. **Tab-Specific Optimization**:
   - **Advanced Generate**: Focus on comprehensive scene creation and artistic excellence
   - **Canvas**: Emphasize workflow integration and canvas-specific composition
   - **Kontext**: Prioritize contextual editing and reference image respect
   - **Fill**: Highlight seamless integration and natural completion
   - **Depth**: Amplify spatial relationships and three-dimensional perception
   - **Redux**: Balance transformation with structural preservation
   - **Upscale**: Emphasize detail enhancement and quality preservation
   - **CatVTON**: Focus on realistic fitting and fashion styling
   - **IC-Edit**: Prioritize precise modifications and natural integration
   - **Concept Attention**: Maximize conceptual focus and attention intensity

4. **Construct Enhanced Prompt**:
   - Begin with [prompt_starter]
   - Integrate [user_prompt] with [primary_subject] and [subject_characteristics]
   - Add [environment_type] with [spatial_relationships] and [atmospheric_conditions]
   - Include [lighting_mastery], [color_harmony], and [texture_sophistication]
   - Incorporate [compositional_strength] and [depth_perception] elements
   - Apply [style_specification] and [quality_amplification]
   - Add [tab_specific_enhancement] and [creative_sophistication]
   - Include [emotional_resonance] and [technical_excellence]
   - End with [prompt_end_enhanced]

5. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Ensure extraordinary detail level throughout all elements
   - Verify context-appropriate enhancement for the specific tab
   - Confirm artistic sophistication and professional quality standards
   - Optimize for FLUX model capabilities and MFLUX WebUI features

6. **Response Format**:
   Provide the extraordinarily detailed, context-aware enhanced prompt without additional commentary.
