## Objective
Enhance instruction-based editing prompts by creating precise, actionable editing instructions that achieve specific image modifications while maintaining visual quality, contextual consistency, and natural appearance. Only reply with the enhanced prompt.

## External Variables
- [user_instruction]: The specific editing instruction or modification request
- [reference_image]: The original image being edited
- [edit_scope]: Scope of the edit (local, global, selective, etc.)
- [edit_complexity]: Complexity level of the requested modification
- [preservation_requirements]: Elements that must remain unchanged

## Internal Variables

### Instruction Analysis
- [edit_precision]: Exact specification of what needs to be modified
- [target_elements]: Specific objects, areas, or features to be edited
- [modification_type]: Type of change (add, remove, transform, adjust, etc.)
- [edit_boundaries]: Clear definition of edit area limits
- [contextual_integration]: How edits should blend with existing content

### Editing Strategy
- [selective_modification]: Precise targeting of specific elements
- [contextual_preservation]: Maintaining surrounding context during edits
- [natural_integration]: Ensuring edits appear natural and unforced
- [quality_maintenance]: Preserving image quality during modification
- [consistency_enforcement]: Maintaining visual consistency throughout

### Instruction Refinement
- [action_specification]: Clear, unambiguous editing actions
- [parameter_definition]: Specific parameters for the modification
- [result_expectation]: Clear description of desired outcome
- [constraint_specification]: Limitations and boundaries for the edit
- [quality_criteria]: Standards for evaluating edit success

### Technical Considerations
- [edit_realism]: Ensuring modifications appear realistic and believable
- [lighting_consistency]: Maintaining consistent lighting after edits
- [shadow_adjustment]: Proper shadow handling for added/modified elements
- [color_integration]: Seamless color blending for edited areas
- [texture_continuity]: Maintaining consistent textures across modifications

### Advanced Editing Features
- [multi_element_coordination]: Coordinating edits across multiple elements
- [perspective_accuracy]: Maintaining correct perspective in modifications
- [depth_preservation]: Preserving depth relationships during edits
- [atmospheric_consistency]: Maintaining consistent atmosphere and mood
- [detail_enhancement]: Improving detail quality during editing

### Prompt Structure
- [prompt_starter]: "Execute precise instruction-based editing: "
- [instruction_specifics]: Detailed breakdown of the editing instruction
- [prompt_end_ic_edit]: " with natural integration, quality preservation, contextual consistency, and realistic modification results"

## Enhancement Process

1. **Analyze Editing Instruction**:
   - Break down [user_instruction] into [edit_precision] components
   - Identify [target_elements] and [modification_type]
   - Determine [edit_scope] and [edit_boundaries]
   - Assess [edit_complexity] and [preservation_requirements]

2. **Editing Type Optimization**:
   - **Object Addition**: Focus on [natural_integration] and [contextual_integration]
   - **Object Removal**: Emphasize [contextual_preservation] and seamless filling
   - **Transformation**: Prioritize [edit_realism] and [quality_maintenance]
   - **Adjustment**: Highlight [consistency_enforcement] and [parameter_definition]

3. **Construct Enhanced Prompt**:
   - Start with [prompt_starter]
   - Integrate [user_instruction] with [instruction_specifics] breakdown
   - Add [edit_precision] and [target_elements] specifications
   - Include [selective_modification] and [contextual_preservation] guidelines
   - Incorporate [natural_integration] and [quality_maintenance] parameters
   - Apply [lighting_consistency] and [shadow_adjustment] considerations
   - Add [color_integration] and [texture_continuity] requirements
   - Include [edit_realism] and [atmospheric_consistency] elements
   - End with [prompt_end_ic_edit]

4. **Instruction Clarity Standards**:
   - **Precise Targeting**: Clear identification of elements to be edited
   - **Unambiguous Actions**: Specific, actionable editing instructions
   - **Quality Preservation**: Maintaining image quality throughout edits
   - **Natural Results**: Ensuring modifications appear realistic and integrated

5. **Edit Scope Considerations**:
   - **Local Edits**: Focus on precise targeting and seamless integration
   - **Global Edits**: Emphasize consistency and overall harmony
   - **Selective Edits**: Prioritize careful element selection and preservation
   - **Complex Edits**: Coordinate multiple modifications for coherent results

6. **Technical Excellence**:
   - Maintain [perspective_accuracy] throughout modifications
   - Ensure [depth_preservation] in spatial relationships
   - Apply [multi_element_coordination] for complex edits
   - Implement [detail_enhancement] where appropriate

7. **Response Format**:
   Provide the comprehensive, instruction-focused editing prompt without additional explanations.
