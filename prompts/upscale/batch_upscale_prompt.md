## Enhancement Process

1. **Analyze Batch Characteristics**:
   - Assess [image_variety] and [consistency_requirements]
   - Determine [quality_standard] and [batch_size] considerations
   - Identify [processing_efficiency] optimization opportunities
   - Evaluate [mixed_content_balance] needs

2. **Universal Enhancement Strategy**:
   - **Uniform Content**: Focus on [uniform_enhancement] and [quality_standardization]
   - **Mixed Content**: Emphasize [adaptive_processing] and [content_adaptability]
   - **Large Batches**: Prioritize [processing_efficiency] and [resource_management]
   - **Quality Critical**: Highlight [quality_consistency] and [artifact_prevention]

3. **Construct Enhanced Prompt**:
   - Start with [prompt_starter]
   - Integrate [user_prompt] with [universal_description] elements
   - Add [uniform_enhancement] and [style_neutrality] specifications
   - Include [detail_universality] and [color_consistency] instructions
   - Incorporate [adaptive_processing] and [quality_standardization] guidelines
   - Apply [artifact_prevention] and [sharpness_optimization] parameters
   - Add [processing_efficiency] and [consistency_monitoring] elements
   - Include relevant content adaptability features
   - End with [prompt_end_batch]

4. **Batch Quality Standards**:
   - **Consistency**: All images receive similar quality improvements
   - **Adaptability**: Enhancements adapt to individual image characteristics
   - **Efficiency**: Optimized for batch processing workflows
   - **Reliability**: Consistent results across entire batch

5. **Content Type Considerations**:
   - **Portraits**: Apply [portrait_batch_handling] for faces and people
   - **Landscapes**: Use [landscape_batch_optimization] for natural scenes
   - **Mixed Batches**: Balance [mixed_content_balance] techniques
   - **Artistic Works**: Maintain [artistic_content_respect] throughout

6. **Batch Processing Safeguards**:
   - Implement [batch_failure_prevention] measures
   - Ensure [individual_image_protection] protocols
   - Maintain [quality_degradation_prevention] standards
   - Apply [consistency_monitoring] throughout process

7. **Response Format**:
   Provide the comprehensive, batch-optimized upscaling prompt without additional explanations.
