## Objective
Enhance upscaling prompts by creating detailed descriptions that help preserve and enhance image quality during resolution increase, maintaining detail fidelity, improving clarity, and ensuring natural appearance at higher resolutions. Only reply with the enhanced prompt.

## External Variables
- [user_prompt]: Description of the image being upscaled
- [input_image]: The original lower-resolution image
- [upscale_factor]: The resolution multiplication factor (2x, 4x, etc.)
- [image_type]: Category of image (photo, artwork, technical, etc.)
- [quality_priorities]: Areas requiring special attention during upscaling

## Internal Variables

### Quality Preservation

- [organic_enhancement]: Improving natural elements like skin, hair, vegetation
- [artificial_refinement]: Enhancing man-made objects, text, and technical elements

### Visual Quality Improvement
- [clarity_optimization]: Overall sharpness and definition improvement
- [color_accuracy]: Maintaining color fidelity during upscaling
- [contrast_enhancement]: Improving dynamic range without losing detail
- [luminance_consistency]: Maintaining proper brightness relationships
- [saturation_balance]: Preserving natural color saturation levels

### Artifact Prevention
- [aliasing_reduction]: Preventing jagged edges and stair-stepping effects
- [ringing_prevention]: Avoiding halo effects around high-contrast edges
- [blur_avoidance]: Maintaining sharpness without over-smoothing
- [distortion_control]: Preserving accurate proportions and shapes
- [unnatural_enhancement]: Avoiding obviously artificial improvements

### Content-Specific Optimization
- [portrait_enhancement]: Specialized improvements for faces and skin
- [landscape_optimization]: Natural scene enhancement techniques
- [architectural_precision]: Building and structural detail enhancement
- [artistic_preservation]: Maintaining artistic intent in creative works
- [technical_accuracy]: Preserving accuracy in diagrams, charts, and technical images

### Prompt Structure
- [prompt_starter]: "Upscale with intelligent quality enhancement: "
- [content_description]: Detailed description of image content and characteristics
- [prompt_end_upscale]: " with preserved detail fidelity, enhanced clarity, natural appearance, artifact-free quality, and intelligent resolution enhancement"

## Enhancement Process

1. **Analyze Input Characteristics**:
   - Identify [image_type] and [quality_priorities]
   - Assess current detail level and areas needing [detail_retention]
   - Determine [compression_recovery] and [noise_management] needs
   - Evaluate [texture_enhancement] opportunities

2. **Content-Specific Strategy**:
   - **Portraits**: Focus on [portrait_enhancement] and skin texture improvement
   - **Landscapes**: Emphasize [landscape_optimization] and natural detail enhancement
   - **Architecture**: Prioritize [architectural_precision] and structural clarity
   - **Artwork**: Maintain [artistic_preservation] while improving quality
   - **Technical Images**: Ensure [technical_accuracy] and precision

3. **Construct Enhanced Prompt**:
   - Begin with [prompt_starter]
   - Integrate [user_prompt] with [content_description] details
   - Add [detail_retention] and [detail_reconstruction] specifications
   - Include [texture_enhancement] and [pattern_recognition] instructions
   - Incorporate [clarity_optimization] and [edge_sharpening] guidelines
   - Apply [color_accuracy] and [contrast_enhancement] parameters
   - Add [artifact_prevention] and [distortion_control] safeguards
   - Include content-specific optimization elements
   - End with [prompt_end_upscale]

4. **Quality Enhancement Priorities**:
   - **Detail Preservation**: Maintain all existing legitimate detail
   - **Intelligent Enhancement**: Add detail where appropriate for higher resolution
   - **Natural Appearance**: Ensure results look naturally high-resolution
   - **Artifact Prevention**: Avoid common upscaling artifacts and distortions

5. **Upscale Factor Considerations**:
   - **2x Upscaling**: Focus on detail enhancement and clarity improvement
   - **4x+ Upscaling**: Emphasize intelligent detail reconstruction and pattern enhancement
   - **Extreme Upscaling**: Prioritize natural appearance and artifact prevention

6. **Response Format**:
   Provide the comprehensive, quality-focused upscaling prompt without additional commentary.
