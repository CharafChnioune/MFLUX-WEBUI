## Detailed Feature Guide

### MFLUX Easy

The MFLUX Easy tab provides a simplified interface for quick image generation:

- **Prompt**: Enter your text prompt describing the image you want to generate.
- **Enhance prompt with Ollama**: Option to improve the prompt using Ollama.
- **Model**: Choose between "schnell" (fast, lower quality) and "dev" (slow, higher quality).
- **Image Format**: Select common image dimensions.
- **LoRA Files**: Select LoRA files to use in generation (if available).

### Advanced Generate

The Advanced Generate tab offers more control over the image generation process:

- All features from MFLUX Easy, plus:
- **Seed**: Set a specific seed for reproducible results.
- **Width/Height**: Set custom dimensions for the generated image.
- **Inference Steps**: Control the number of denoising steps.
- **Guidance Scale**: Adjust how closely the image follows the text prompt.
- **Export Metadata**: Option to export generation parameters as JSON.

### ControlNet

The ControlNet tab allows for guided image generation:

- All features from Advanced Generate, plus:
- **Control Image**: Upload an image to guide the generation process.
- **ControlNet Strength**: Adjust the influence of the control image.
- **Save Canny Edge Detection Image**: Option to save the edge detection result.

Note: ControlNet requires [InstantX/FLUX.1-dev-Controlnet-Canny](https://huggingface.co/InstantX/FLUX.1-dev-Controlnet-Canny), which was trained for the `dev` model. It can work well with `schnell`, but performance is not guaranteed.

### Image-to-Image

The Image-to-Image tab allows you to transform existing images using new prompts:

- **Prompt**: Enter your text prompt describing how you want to transform the image.
- **Enhance prompt with Ollama**: Option to improve the prompt using Ollama.
- **Initial Image**: Upload the image you want to transform.
- **Init Image Strength**: Control how much the initial image influences the final result (0.0 - 1.0).
- **Model**: Choose the model to use for image transformation.
- **Seed**: Set a specific seed for reproducible results.
- **Width/Height**: Set dimensions for the generated image.
- **Inference Steps**: Control the number of denoising steps.
- **Guidance Scale**: Adjust how closely the image follows the text prompt.
- **LoRA Files**: Select LoRA files to use in transformation (if available).
- **LoRA Scale**: Adjust the influence of the LoRA files.
- **Export Metadata**: Option to export generation parameters as JSON.

### Dreambooth Fine-Tuning

The Dreambooth Fine-Tuning tab allows you to train and customize models:

- Train new models using your own images
- Fine-tune existing models for specific styles or subjects
- Customize training parameters and configurations
- Monitor training progress

### Models

The Models tab enables you to manage models:

- **Download LoRA**: Download LoRA models directly from within the interface.
- **Download and Add Model**: Download models from Hugging Face and add them to available models.
- **Quantize Model**: Create optimized versions of the models:
  - Choose which model to quantize ("dev" or "schnell").
  - Select the quantization level (4-bit or 8-bit).
  - View the quantization output in a dedicated textbox.

## LoRA Integration

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) allows for fine-tuned models to be used in image generation:

1. Place your LoRA files (`.safetensors`) in the `lora` directory.
2. Select the desired LoRA file(s) from the dropdown menu in the WebUI.
3. Use the LoRA download functionality in the Models tab to easily add new LoRA models.

## Ollama Integration

MFLUX WebUI integrates Ollama for prompt enhancement:

- Enable the "Enhance prompt with Ollama" option to automatically improve your prompts.
- Adjust Ollama settings, including the model and system prompt, in the Ollama Settings section.
